Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year. Wolff became Austin FC’s first Homegrown signing in September 2021 at age 16 and was the first Homegrown player to appear in a match for the Verde & Black in the team’s 3-1 win over Sporting Kansas City on November 3, 2021. He has since gone on to tally 137 appearances for the Club. As a youth international, Wolff competed with the U.S. at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in June 2023, starting all five (5) of the team’s matches and contributing to three (3) goals as the U.S. reached the tournament quarterfinals. MLS launched the U22 Initiative in 2021, a roster mechanism designed to make it easier for clubs to acquire and retain top young players. Wolff’s new U22 Initiative contract means his salary will count against the Club’s salary budget cap at a reduced rate, and he now occupies a Senior roster slot.

Bell, 28, joins the Verde & Black on a deal guaranteed through June 2028 with an option for the 2028-29 season. “I’m thrilled to join Austin FC and I can’t wait to experience Q2 Stadium as a member of the home team,” said Bell. “I’m already looking forward to the start of preseason and beginning this next chapter of my career.” Bell has made a total of 62 career MLS appearances during two (2) seasons with New England, one (1) with St. Louis, and most recently two (2) with Seattle. He won the Supporters’ Shield while with New England in 2021 and last year lifted the Leagues Cup as a member of the Sounders. Born in Rockville, Maryland, Bell represents Jamaica at the international level with two (2) previous appearances to his name. “Jon is a versatile defender who is familiar with MLS and capable of playing in different positions on the backline,” said Austin FC Sporting Director Rodolfo Borrell. “He is a good addition to our defensive group and we welcome him to Austin.” Bell played collegiate soccer at University of Maryland, Baltimore County, playing 56 matches in four (4) seasons. San Jose Earthquakes drafted Bell in the 2020 MLS SuperDraft, though he joined New England Revolution II in July 2020 and made his professional debut there.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year. Wolff became Austin FC’s first Homegrown signing in September 2021 at age 16 and was the first Homegrown player to appear in a match for the Verde & Black in the team’s 3-1 win over Sporting Kansas City on November 3, 2021. He has since gone on to tally 137 appearances for the Club. As a youth international, Wolff competed with the U.S. at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in June 2023, starting all five (5) of the team’s matches and contributing to three (3) goals as the U.S. reached the tournament quarterfinals. MLS launched the U22 Initiative in 2021, a roster mechanism designed to make it easier for clubs to acquire and retain top young players. Wolff’s new U22 Initiative contract means his salary will count against the Club’s salary budget cap at a reduced rate, and he now occupies a Senior roster slot.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.

Wolff’s new contract is guaranteed through June 2030. “I have learned and experienced so much during my time in Austin so far, both as a young player and a person,” said Wolff. “I’m excited to commit once again to the Club and to the city, and I’m confident we can achieve big things.” In 2025, Wolff was named to the MLS 22 Under 22 List for the third consecutive year, making a jump to fourth spot on the annual list of the league’s best young players. He was Austin FC’s Offensive Player of the Year, leading the team in goal contributions across all competitions with seven (7) goals and 12 assists (both career single-season bests). Six (6) of those goals were match-winners, setting a new Club record for the most game-winning goal contributions in a single season. Wolff was voted to the MLS Team of the Matchday a team-high five (5) times throughout the year.
